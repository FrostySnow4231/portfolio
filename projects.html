            <h5>App Inventor</h5>
            
            <p>For this project my objective was to create a game that was able 
            to function on a mobile app called App Inventor. My partner and I 
            decided to do a mini golf game. The game itself was still very beta 
            due to how the app functioned. Some features that we included were 
            spikes that would send the player back to the beginning. 
            We also included large obstacles that would impede the player. 
            The map was fairly small because we had to keep in mind that most 
            players would play on a mobile device. I was in charge of coding and 
            some of the research that was done on how to make certain things 
            look more aesthetic and also made some of our documentation.</p>

            <h5>Image Manipulation Project (March 23, 2019)</h5>
            
            <p>In this project, my partner and I needed to create code that 
            would be able to add a border and add a frame to an image of our 
            clients choice. We were also able to create a way to put geometric
            shapes such as triangles on each corner on the image that was 
            given to us. This project was very good to work on because it 
            allowed me to show and display my cooperation when working with 
            teammates.</p>
